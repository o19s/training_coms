## Certificates, Surveys and Emails oh my

All OSC trainings involve personalized communication, whether that's the welcome email or course certificate. This repo is a collection of R scripts to help automate some of that.

### Certificates

Generate a batch of certificates as PDF files outputted to `certs_new/`

Requires: 

* Certificate template in PowerPoint: certs/template.ppt
* Class roster: certs/roster.csv

Getting R to properly edit the PowerPoint is finicky, change things carefully.
